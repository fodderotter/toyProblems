// Dear Coder,

// We at [SomeLargeCompany] have decided to expand on the functionality of our online text editor.

// We have written a new function that accepts a phrase, a word and an array of indexes. We want this function to return the phrase, with the word inserted at each of the indexes given by the array.

// Please fix this for us, and you will be showered with money.

// Yours Sincerely, [SomeLargeCompany]

// insertAtIndexes("James Jane", " Likes",[5])//=="James Likes Jane"
// insertAtIndexes("'I' write a wi' said Phi","ll", [3,14,24]) // == "'I'll write a will' said Phill"
